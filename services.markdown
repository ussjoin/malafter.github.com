title: What We Do
---

At Malice Afterthought, we firmly believe that anything that can be thought of, is something upon which we can execute. From securing corporate installations-- from the cryptographic to network layers-- to software security and design, and from mentoring teams of young programmers to extensive visualization of raw datapoints, we want to help you achieve your technological goals.

We are available for work on a contract or ongoing basis, and we deal with both large and small projects; if you think you'd like to achieve more than what your neighborhood "tech guru" can handle, why not [contact us][]?

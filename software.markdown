* Ham Exam
  * Ham Exam is a practice examination generator for the Amateur ("Ham") Radio license examinations.
  
    Ham Exam gives you the tools to prepare for the FCC licensing exams for Amateur "Ham" Radio licenses. Unlike other programs, Ham Radio lets you test at any of the three license levels for one low price: Technician, General, or Amateur Extra. Every exam meets all the requirements set forth, so no matter what Volunteer Examination Coordinator is administering your exam (ARRL or otherwise), you'll be prepared. Taking practice examinations is the best way to ensure you'll be prepared for the exam; don't wait to start studying! With Ham Exam, you can take unlimited practice exams spanning the entire question pool from which *all* exams must draw!
    
    Ham Exam is available on the Android Market, and is pending moderation on the App Store.
